😍💰💰💰 ---- Vault smart contract by hardhat ---- 💰💰💰😍

The task is to create a Vault smart-contract, written in Solidity and suitable for deployment on Ethereum. The Vault should provide the following functionality:

💵 Users may deposit and later withdraw ETH. They may not withdraw more than they have individually deposited (no negative balances). 💵
💶 Users may deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens of their choosing. Again, they may not withdraw more than they have deposited of a given token. 💶
💷 After depositing ETH, users may wrap their ETH into WETH within the vault (i.e. without first withdrawing). Similarly, users may unwrap their WETH into ETH within the vault. 💷
